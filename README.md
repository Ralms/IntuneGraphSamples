Samples scripts to interact with Intune

Most of the scripts available here are modifications of existing scripts from: https://github.com/microsoftgraph/powershell-intune-samples 

The scripts are licensed "as-is." under the MIT License.

Disclaimer
Some script samples retrieve information from your Intune tenant, and others create, delete or update data in your Intune tenant.  Understand the impact of each sample script prior to running it; samples should be run using a non-production or "test" tenant account.
